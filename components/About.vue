      I am web developer and network engineer. I have about eight year
      experience in information technology. Coding has become my passion. I have
      worked on several different projects. The development stack that I mainly
      use is HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby on Rails. I have also worked with
      other technologies, but the aforementioned or the ones I am most familiar
      with using. I enjoy learning so I am always looking to enhance my skills
      to make me a better programmer and to produce the best product for my
      clients.
